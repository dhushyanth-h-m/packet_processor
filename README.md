```

### Explaining the Results

This benchmark shows the engine processing network traffic with the following characteristics:

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Processing over 6,500 packets per second
   - Handling bandwidth of approximately 61 Mbps
   - Zero packet drops, indicating efficient processing

2. **Traffic Analysis**:
   - The traffic is entirely IPv4 (no IPv6)
   - Predominantly UDP traffic (99.72%) with minimal TCP (0.28%)
   - Most packets are jumbo-sized (>1025 bytes), suggesting large data transfers

3. **System Notes**:
   - The "BIOCSBLEN: Invalid argument" warning relates to an attempt to optimize the Berkeley Packet Filter buffer size. This is a minor issue and doesn't affect functionality.
   - The engine can capture in promiscuous mode, seeing all packets on the network interface, not just those addressed to the host.

The high percentage of jumbo packets combined with the UDP protocol dominance indicates this benchmark was likely capturing streaming media, backup traffic, or possibly gaming data - applications that prioritize throughput over guaranteed delivery.

The zero packet drop rate demonstrates the engine's efficiency, even when handling large volumes of data.

## Building

Clone the repository and build with CMake:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhushyanth-h-m/packet_processor
cd packet-processor
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Usage

The library can be used as a standalone command-line tool or integrated into your own C++ applications.

### Command-Line Tool

```bash
# Basic packet capture
sudo ./packet_processor -i en0

# With BPF filter
sudo ./packet_processor -i en0 -f "tcp port 80"

# List available interfaces
./packet_processor -L
```

### Library Integration

```cpp
#include "packet_processor/packet_processor.h"

// Configure the packet processor
packet_processor::PacketProcessorConfig config;
config.device_name = "en0";
config.capture_buffer_size = 2 * 1024 * 1024;
config.promiscuous_mode = true;

// Create packet processor
packet_processor::PacketProcessor processor(config);

// Add a custom packet handler
class MyPacketHandler : public packet_processor::PacketHandler {
public:
    bool handlePacket(const packet_processor::Packet& packet) override {
        // Process packet here
        return true;
    }
};

auto handler = std::make_shared<MyPacketHandler>();
processor.addHandler(handler);

// Initialize and start
processor.initialize();
processor.start();

// ... do other work or wait ...

// Stop when done
processor.stop();
```

## Examples

The following examples are included:

- **basic_capture**: Simple packet capture and analysis
- **connection_monitor**: Track and display active network connections
- **protocol_analyzer**: Analyze protocol distribution in network traffic

Run the examples:

```bash
sudo ./examples/basic_capture en0
sudo ./examples/connection_monitor en0
sudo ./examples/protocol_analyzer en0
```

## Benchmarking

A comprehensive benchmarking tool is included to measure performance:

```bash
sudo ./benchmark en0 -t 60 -o results.txt
```

Options:
- `-f, --filter <filter>`: BPF filter to use
- `-t, --time <seconds>`: Benchmark duration in seconds (default: 60)
- `-c, --count-only`: Only count packets, don't process them
- `-o, --output <filename>`: Output file for results
- `-p, --processing-threads <num>`: Number of processing threads (default: auto)

## Performance Tuning

For optimal performance:

1. **Buffer Sizes**: Adjust `capture_buffer_size` and `zero_copy_buffer_size` based on available memory
2. **Thread Count**: Set `processing_threads` to match your CPU architecture
3. **BPF Filters**: Use efficient BPF filters to reduce processing overhead
4. **Ring Buffer Count**: Increase `ring_buffer_count` for higher throughput scenarios
5. **Real-time Priority**: On supported systems, enable real-time thread priority

## Architecture

The packet processor consists of several key components:

1. **Packet Capture**: Uses libpcap with macOS-specific optimizations
2. **Zero-Copy Buffer**: Memory-mapped ring buffers for efficient data transfer
3. **Thread Pool**: Multi-threaded processing architecture optimized for macOS
4. **Protocol Parser**: Fast packet header parsing for common protocols
5. **Connection Tracker**: Efficient tracking of concurrent connections
6. **Statistics**: Comprehensive performance metrics collection
